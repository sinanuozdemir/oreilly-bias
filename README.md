# Algorithmic Bias in Machine Learning


This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for Algorithmic Bias in Machine Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/algorithmic-bias-in-machine-learning/0636920080193/0636920080192)

This training provides an overview to identifying and mitigating bias in structured and unstructured data. Learn definitions of biases and methodologies to identify biases in data. This session is a healthy mix of theoretical and practical hands-on coding with biased data.

We use tools including TorchDrift, Scikit-learn, and Transformers to build and scrutinize machine learning models to optimize for both performance and fairness. We also directly engineer data to enhance the fairness in our overall pipelines. There are several code examples throughout the training to help solidify the theoretical concepts introduced.
